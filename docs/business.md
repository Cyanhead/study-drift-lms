# Business Model

StudyDrift is not intended to be yet another learning management system. Instead, the goal is to focus more on student learning.

## Sharable Content

One of the distinguishing factors of StudyDrift is the ability to share content with other users. This allows for a more collaborative learning experience as well as opportunities for users to monitize their content.

Types of items that can be shared:

- Course
- Module
- Content Item / Learning Activity
- Assessment

## Experiemental Learning

To help foster the ability for instructors to run experiements around new content, learning activities, and assessments, StudyDrift has A/B testing, data collection, and other features to measure success.
